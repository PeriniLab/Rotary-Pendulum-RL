# Documentation **(TODO)**

Next thing to do is setting up a documentation system for this project.
I was thinking of using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) to generate the documentation with a [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) theme.
If you have any suggestions, please let me know.
