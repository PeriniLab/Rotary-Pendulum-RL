Installation
=============

In the following sections I will guide you through the installation process of the required components
for this project. From the python dependencies (for running the simulation and controlling the robot)
to the set-up of the microcontroller firmware development.

If you would like to jump straight to the building and assembling of the robot and then come back later,
you can do so by skipping to the :doc:`bill of material hardware/bill_of_materials` section.
